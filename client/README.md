# graphQL_App

# app building steps:
#   1 - create a react app in the client folder; in this case the server folder is empty
#   2 - install all the dependencies needed for this app: @apollo/client, @visx, express-graphql, graphql, graphql-ws and react-spinners 
#   3 - using the Apollo library I established the connection to the GraphQL endpoint 
#   4 - when I got the data from the server I had a challenge to convert the date at every post that was created in a readeble format
#   5 - after I succeded the last step I read, watch and leard about VISX and I implemented a modern histogram for the data requested
#   6 - commit every big step or progress I make
